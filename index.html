		<h2>hello.</h2>
		
		<p>I'm an user experience designer based in New York City who is passionate about creating delightful and useful experiences. Outside of work, I'm a dabbler of many trades, currently trying to master some which include basketball, ramen slurping, lettering, podcasting, and storytelling through different mediums. Currently, there are just not enough hours in the day to accomplish everything but I have been spending a lot of time working on a personal passion project called <a href = "https://whynotexperiments.wordpress.com"> Why Not Experiments</a>. Feel free to check it out!</p>
